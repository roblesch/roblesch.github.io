I recently submitted a proposal for a Directed Research project next Spring - it's been preliminarily approved but will take some time to finalize. I may extend this post to have some more meat on its bones in the future, but for now I'm just throwing up the proposal.

I owe the suggestion of EARS as a candidate project to DreamWorks' Keith Jeffrey via Mike Day. Thank you Mike for continuing to entertain my emails, and thank you to Professor Neumann for offering to advise this project ðŸ¥²

### Update

This project was approved! I'll be working under the advisory of Professor Ulrich Neumann toward completion of a report at end of Spring. I share progress posts every other Tuesday. I'll keep updating this page with links to each post.
