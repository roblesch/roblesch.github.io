Our end of semester project was the implementation of a simple ray tracer. Previous experience with [CSE167x](/2020/10/25/edx-graphics.html) and [Peter Shirley's In One Weekend Series](/2020/05/26/raytracing-weekend.html) made implementation more familiar, though I still fell for some math typos.

This assignment required ray-sphere and ray-triangle intersection, phong shading, phong lighting, and shadow rays. For extra credit I've also implemented soft shadows and anti aliasing.
