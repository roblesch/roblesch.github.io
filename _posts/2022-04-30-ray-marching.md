It's finally done. As an arduous semester comes to a close, I'd like to share a report I recently worked on for Professor Neumann's *3-D Graphics and Rendering* where we used Ray Marching to generate various procedural materials and surfaces. Take a peek for an overview of Ray Marching techniques, interesting properties of implicit intersection tests, approximations of clouds, constructive solid geometry, and fractals.
