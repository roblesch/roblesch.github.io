I recently worked on a report for Professor Neumann's course *3-D Graphics and Rendering* where we use Ray Marching techniques to generate various procedural materials and surfaces. Check out the report for an overview of Ray Marching techniques, interesting properties of implicit intersection tests, approximations of clouds, Constructive Solid Geometry and Fractals.
