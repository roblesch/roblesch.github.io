For this semester's Computer Graphics course we've had a project where we create a virtual roller coaster scene in OpenGL with tracks represented by [Catmull-Rom Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline).

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Catmull-Rom_Spline.png/440px-Catmull-Rom_Spline.png" alt="spline" width="250"/></a>

To generate the splines we are given a sequence of control points. We generate points along the spline using the following -

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x & y & z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
u^3 & u^2 & u & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-s & 2 - s & s - 2 & s \\
2s & s - 3 & 3 - 2s & -s \\
-s & 0 & s & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_{i - 1} \\
p_{i} \\
p_{i + 1} \\
p_{i + 2} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where the points $$p_{i - 1 ... i + 2}$$ are four sequential control points, $$s$$ describes the stiffness of the spline (in this project $$1/2$$), and $$u$$ is the step distance along the spline (in this project $$0.01$$).

When the control points are read, I calculated and cached each of the points along the spline. I additionally cache the tangent, normal and binormal at each step to draw square rails with crossbars. The rails are `GL_QUADS`, and their normals are whichever is appropriate of the normal binormal or tangent to support `GL_LIGHTING`.

The roller coaster is floating in a skybox. Last weekend I saw [Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/), so I threw some images from the film as textures of the box.

Here's the result. It's not particularly stunning but I think it illustrates the Catmull-Rom Splines well.
