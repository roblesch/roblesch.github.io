Between July 2020 and May 2021 I've been participating in the [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals) program through my work at Microsoft. In this program, I am a Co-Teacher for the [AP Computer Science A](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) course at the [Cambridge Rindge and Latin School](https://crls.cpsd.us/). My responsibilities include building and delivering lessons on Java fundamentals, as well as leading lab work and grading projects.

Teaching through the pandemic has been a huge challenge. I can't take too much credit for how well we've managed to get through; the teaching team and especially the CRLS staff we've been working with have all done excellent work, and I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to teach with them.

I've learned a lot about how I communicate Computer Science concepts, and especially gained significant perspective on keeping content approachable. If anyone out there is considering volunteering with a teaching program, I can't recommend TEALS enough.
