Happy Lunar New Year!

As the semester begins to gain some momentum I have been focused on implementing the core path tracing algorithms that will serve as the foundation for future explorations of roulette, splitting, ADDRS and EARS. One significant change from the last post is that I have discarded GLM as the mathematical core for this project in favor of 

# Intersection tests

## Square

## Cube

# Normals

# Reviewing Monte Carlo Methods

# Implementing

## Turning back the clock on Tungsten

# sampling loop

# pdfs

# results

# todo

better sampler (at least seeded uniform)

general code cleanup / reorganization

multiple samples per pixel (should be straightforward)
