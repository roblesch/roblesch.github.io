Welcome to my personal site. The bulk of my projects focus on computer graphics, but I may write some occasional posts on broader multimedia, engineering process, or rock climbing. You can find more about me at [my about page](about).

Content before 2022 is posted retroactively as I migrate old work to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
