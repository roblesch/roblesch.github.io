        Professor Ulrich Neumann. Russian Roulette and Splitting are techniques which can improve the efficiency of an estimator without introducing
        bias. This project implements a unidirectional forward path tracer demonstrating Rath et. al.'s *EARS* (SIGGRAPH 2022), a learning-based
        method for the iterative optimization of Russian Roulette & Splitting parameters with respect to estimator efficiency.
