## Hello!
I'm Christian, a [MSc. Computer Science (Multimedia and Creative Technologies)](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/multimedia-creative-technologies/) student at USC interested in light transport, rendering and simulation. Previously I worked at [Autodesk](/blog/2022/09/02/summer-standards.html) and [Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/CSE/).

Check out my [blog](/blog), some selected [projects](/projects), and my [resume](/about).

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and made with [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) & customizations to [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). It is always a work in progress :) if you find something broken, shoot me a message!
